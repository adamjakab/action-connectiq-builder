# ConnectIQ Builder GitHub Action

ConnectIQ Builder is a GitHub Action (`adamjakab/action-connectiq-builder@v1`) that can be used to test and build ConnectIQ applications.

## Important notice

The `PACKAGE` operation builds the packaged app inside the docker container but it does not yet have a way to upload this package and attach it to a release of the repository. This is the goal of this operation but it requires more work.

## Usage

USe it in your github workflow as `uses: adamjakab/action-connectiq-builder@v1` with the inputs described below.

### Inputs

The following inputs are available under the `with` keyword:

- `operation`: Required. [Default: TEST]. The main two operations you can chose between are:

  - `TEST` - compiles your application with the `--unit-test` flag and will run run those tests for the specified device. If any of the tests fail will cause the workflow to fail.
  - `PACKAGE` - packages your application by running `monkeyc` with `--package-app` and `--release` flags.
  - `INFO` - displays some information. Used for debugging purposes.

- `path`: Required. [Default: .] The path of the application to test. By default, the root of the repository will be used.

- `device`: Required. [Default: fr235] The id of the device used to run the operation. By default, a Forerunner 235 device is be used. The full list of devices can be found [here](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/reference-guides/devices-reference/#devicereference).

- `check_type_level`: Required. [Default: 2] The type level check used when compiling the application with `monkeyc`. The available options (0-3) are described [here](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/monkey-c/monkey-types/).

- `certificate`: Optional. The base64 encoded version of the certificate to be used to compile the application. If not specified, a temporary certificate will be used for the test operation. For `PACKAGE` operation you must supply your own. Make sure to store it as a repository secret and add the variable name to your workflow. To convert your existing developer key into a base64 encoded version run `cat my_developer_key | base64 -w0`. The `-w0` argument is important because it will not wrap the lines (no line breaks).

- `package_name`: Optional. The file name of the package that is built when operation mode is PACKAGE.

## Outputs

- `status`: If the opearion ran successfully, the value of this output will be `success`. Otherwise `failure`.

- `package_path`: The path of the generated package (when operation = `PACKAGE`) relative to the input path. This can be useful if you want to add the package to a release. you can reference the package in the workflow as `${{ github.workspace }}/${{ steps.package_app.outputs.package_path }}` where `package_app` is the id of this step.

### Examples

A simple usage for `TEST` operation will look something like this:

```yml
steps:
  - name: Test my garmin app
    id: run_tests
    uses: adamjakab/action-connectiq-builder@v1
    with:
      operation: TEST
      device: fr235
```

It is also very common to use a matrix of devices to `TEST` against all of them. That can be easily set up by having a setup similar to this:

```yml
jobs:
  test:
    name: Matrix Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        device: [fenix3, fr235, vivoactive4]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Test on device ${{ matrix.device }}
        id: run_tests
        uses: adamjakab/action-connectiq-builder@v1
        with:
          operation: TEST
          device: ${{ matrix.device }}
```

To use the `PACKAGE` operation the configuration will need to have your developer key (`certificate`):

```yml
steps:
  - name: Package my garmin app
    id: package_app
    uses: adamjakab/action-connectiq-builder@v1
    with:
      operation: PACKAGE
      certificate: ${{ secrets.connectiq_dev_key }}
      package_name: myApp_${{ github.ref_name }}.iq
```

## Notes

- This acion relies on the docker image [ghcr.io/adamjakab/connectiq-builder](ghcr.io/adamjakab/connectiq-builder).

- Notes on updating: After a new version tag has been pushed to GH, the `v1` release needs to be updated to reference the new tag. Additionally v1 branch needs to be updated so that it is aligned with the master branch at the new tag.
